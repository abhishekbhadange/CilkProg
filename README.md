Cilk programs for matrix operations 

The project focuses on Cilk programming and evaluation. There are total four Cilk programs for carrying out square matrix 
addition and multiplication using two different methods, namely static work division and recursive divide and conquer. The 
programs take three inputs: the number of Cilk workers, the number of splits (i.e. the number of pieces into which to split the 
matrices) and the size of the square matrix. Finally, evaluation is done by giving a large size for the square matrix and noting 
the execution times for different combinations of the number of splits and the number of cilk workers.
